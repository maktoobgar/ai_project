# Tic-Tac-Toe
Here is the Tic Tac Toe game with an artificial intelligence using "__Alpha Beta Purning__" algorithm.\
This little project has 2 files ("**main.py**" and "**game_class.py**") that "**main.py**" is just a fast test for the main written algorithm ("**game_class.py**").
## main.py
Just run this file by ```python3 main.py``` to see how the algorithm works.
## game_class.py
Our main code is here.\
I declared 7 diffrent classes that are like this:
* **Environment Class**
* **Board Class**
* **Node Class**
* **Nut Class**
* **Colors Class**
### Environment Class
The biggest class in the project.\
This class involves the solving algorithm using __Alpha Beta Purning__.\
There are three functions named "**start_solve**", "**maximum**" and "**minimum**" that "**start_solve**" is a functionality that changes turns between the bot and the player ("**maximum**" and "**minimum**" functions are used for decisions that the bot takes).\
"**maximum**" and "**minimum**" functions returns a value and recursively, "**start_solve**" function by those values decides what to do next.
### Board Class
__Board Class__ is the second biggest class after __Environment Class__.\
This class has a 3x3 dictionary attribute named "__nodes__" with keys like (x, y) and values of __Node__ object.\
Also with printing a board object, you can see the actual graphical autogenerated board and if the game is done, you can see the answer ofcourse.\
### Node Class
Just a simple class that has less functions and handles less of the work but has **x**, **y**, **nut** and **green** attribute.\
**x** and **y** attributes are the place of the node in nodes attribute of board.\
**nut** can have two diffrent values of **Nut Class**.
### Nut Class
An Enum Class that Used to set Nut.X or Nut.O values on **nut** attribute of Node class.
### Colors Class
An Enum Class that has some color codes used for beauty of Board.
