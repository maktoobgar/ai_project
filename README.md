# An Education Project
This project is made for education purposes (and taking grades in University of course).\
I solved two diffrent problems and created one game in one repository and made a README.md file for each one of them (just doing what my master asked).\
Hope everyone like it.

## Maze Problem
I solved this problem with A* algorithm (Comming Soon).

## 8 Queens Problem
I solved this problem with simulated annealing algorithm (Comming Soon).

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Designed the game with Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm (Comming Soon).
